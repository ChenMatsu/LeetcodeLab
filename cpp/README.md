## Introduction

The goal of this repository is to keep a well-documented set of C++ solutions for various Leetcode problems. Each problem is solved with an emphasis on clarity, efficiency, and proper usage of C++ features.

This project is a great resource for:

- Learning how to solve common algorithmic challenges.
- Improving your coding skills in C++.
- Understanding different approaches to solving the same problem.

## Structure

The repository is organized by problem categories (arrays, linked lists, dynamic programming, etc.). Each problem has its own folder, which contains:

- **Problem statement** (as a `README.md` or comment in the code).
- **C++ Solution file**.
- **Explanation** of the approach used (either in code comments or an accompanying explanation file).

Example structure:

```
Leetcode-Solutions/
│
├── Arrays/
│   ├── two_sum.cpp
│   └── three_sum.cpp
│
├── LinkedLists/
│   ├── reverse_linked_list.cpp
│   └── merge_two_sorted_lists.cpp
│
├── DynamicProgramming/
│   ├── fibonacci.cpp
│   └── climbing_stairs.cpp
│
└── README.md
```

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Leetcode-Solutions.git
   cd Leetcode-Solutions
   ```

2. **Navigate through the problem categories**: Find the problem you are interested in and review the solution in its respective folder.

3. **Run the C++ code**: Each solution is a self-contained C++ program that you can compile and run using your preferred C++ compiler.

   Example to compile and run:
   ```bash
   g++ two_sum.cpp -o two_sum
   ./two_sum
   ```

4. **Understand the approach**: Review the comments in the code to understand the logic and thought process behind the solution.

## Topics Covered

This repository covers problems across a wide range of categories:

- **Arrays**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Strings**
- **Binary Trees**
- **Hash Maps**
- **Backtracking**
- **Recursion**
- **Sorting and Searching**
- **Graphs**
- **Bit Manipulation**
- **Greedy Algorithms**

Each problem is categorized accordingly, so you can easily find problems based on the topic you're working on.

In fact, I am not pretty familiar with dealing strings. It is much easier for me to solve math problems. Therefore, it is a good chance
to know how to do such a basic computation, "Binary Adder". This reminds me of the travel that I went to Kyoto University with my friends, 
and see a complex adder which was honored with Nobel Prize.

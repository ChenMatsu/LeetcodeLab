# Leetcode
I tried LeetCode. I discovered I can't code and I'm not leet. So... looks like I'm going to have to read 'Python For Kids' for a third time.

OK, this is the third time I created the same repository "Leetcode" in order to store my practice code on Leetcode, and what's interesting is that
I messed up using github command for several times, and it still frustrated me today, YES, Again. So far, I am still not certain about how to push
new files to the same repository, maybe is because I didn't clone this repository from github and I just created a new file on my working dir, and 
just push it to my github. Without a doubt, problems come to find me. Anyway, after google them, I hope I would not mess the up again...

Well, two days ago? Maybe, I just figured out that I should change my direcoty in command line, for instance, I clone this repository LeetcodePractice, and then, I will see a folder named LeetcodePractice. In this circumstance, I ought to change my dir into "LeetcodePractice", and type git command in this dir. 

1. First change "Directory" to where you just clone from the github 
2. Type git init and start work on your codes! That's It! 

Conclusion ->  In my case ->
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop> git clone https://github.com/HiiragiMatu/LeetcodePractice
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop> cd LeetcodePractice
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop> git init
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop> git remote add "Name You Like" https://github.com/HiiragiMatu/LeetcodePractice
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop> git add LeetcodePractice
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop> git commit -m "n-th commits or other comments , whatever"
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop> git push -u "Name You Like" master
Note: When you want to push more times, the last command could be just "git push"

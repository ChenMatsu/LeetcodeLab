# Leetcode
I tried LeetCode. I discovered I can't code and I'm not leet. So... looks like I'm going to have to read 'Python For Kids' for a third time.

OK, this is the third time I created the same repository "Leetcode" in order to store my practice code on Leetcode, and what's interesting is that
I messed up using github command for several times, and it still frustrated me today, YES, Again. So far, I am still not certain about how to push
new files to the same repository, maybe is because I didn't clone this repository from github and I just created a new file on my working dir, and 
just push it to my github. Without a doubt, problems come to find me. Anyway, after google them, I hope I would not mess the up again...
